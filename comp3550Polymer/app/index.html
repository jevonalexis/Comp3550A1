                <h2 class="paper-font-display2"> Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  Water scarcity already affects every continent. Around 1.2 billion people, or almost one-fifth of the world's population, live in areas of physical scarcity, and 500 million people are approaching this situation. Another 1.6 billion people, or almost one quarter of the world's population, face economic water shortage (where countries lack the necessary infrastructure to take water from rivers and aquifers).
                  <br/>
                  Water scarcity is among the main problems to be faced by many societies and the World in the XXIst century. Water use has been growing at more than twice the rate of population increase in the last century, and, although there is no global water scarcity as such, an increasing number of regions are chronically short of water.
                  <br/>
                  Water scarcity is both a natural and a human-made phenomenon. There is enough freshwater on the planet for seven billion people but it is distributed unevenly and too much of it is wasted, polluted and unsustainably managed.

                <h3 class="paper-font-display1"> What is the Problem?</h3>
                <p>
                    In the early 2000's there had been many debates on water scarcity and the proportionaly inverse relationship between water availability and population size. 
                    <br/>
                    Though at a global level there is more than sufficient water to meet all of humanity's needs water scarcity is still a problem. 
                </p>
                <h4> Causes </h4>
                  <p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>
                        Just like wealth, water, is not distributed equally among countries as well as within them.
                        <br/> For example, While there are several countries in the Middle east that water-stressed Brazil
                        and Canada have more water than they can ever use. Yet areas of northeast Brazil are drought-prone.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Access to water as a productive resource has infrustructural requirements. These infrustructural requirements are also unequally distributes among and within countries.  
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                </paper-material>
                <paper-material elevation="1">
                <h4> Implications </h4>
                <p>
                    Currently, about 700 million persons in 43 countries live below the water-stress threshold of 1700 cubic metres per person. It is estimated that by 2025 that number would reach 3 billion, as water-stressed in China, India and Sub-Saharan Africa.
                    <br/>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Water stress is also reflected in ecological stress. River systems that no longer reach the sea,
                    shrinking lakes and sinking groundwater tables are among the most noticeable symptoms of water overuse.
                    <br/>
                    Another cause for concern is the depletion of groundwater in South Asia. Ground water tables are falling by more than a metre a year in parts of India. This then puts future agricultural production at risk.
